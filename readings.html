  ‘The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US would Mess it Up’ -and rightly so. As we know now, there is an onslaught of dangerous misinformation and corporate monopolization of information on the mainly American-owned World Wide Web of today - although, to be fair, any for profit system spawned from the recesses of capitalistic greed would produce a close replication, no matter how ‘politely Canadian’ it may be. However, it is interesting to muse about another alternate reality where Canada has their own internet, and how those distinctly non-Americanisms of the Canadian ideations may have produced a slightly different network of media and open form information. It’s nice to think that a Canadian government run internet may not sell the information of its people to corporations, while using the behavioral and psychological intersections of addiction to fuse our brains to the social media mutant that plagues much of society today. I have some faith in Canada but maybe not that much.

  As for Counterculture to Cyberculture, the imagery of the computer nerds crossing over with the hippies and the ‘freaks’ - as so many people from that era called themselves if they were the outsiders, but not necessarily hippies- is not a foreign concept to me as it is similar to the history of electroacoustic and early electronic music (I am majoring in Electroacoustic studies). While the computer systems of those days lived exclusively in the basements of the higher education -where ‘cyber-futurists’ would interact with complex systems while contemplating the positive impact it could have on art and culture - the same was happening with giant synthesizers and oscillators ‘next door’. There was always an underground approach to ‘higher technologies’ throughout the ages. Even though, to the majority of the public, computers and technology was originally thought of for the elite, in actuality it was the counterculturalists who were the first to manifest the push for the open access information-super highway that was made possible by the internet. It’s ingrained into its history, and thus branded in every circuit.
</p>
<p>‘You don't have to leave industrial society, but you don't have to accept it the way it is…’. This quote from From Counterculture to Cyberculture rings particularly true to me right now, with the very polarized group of radicalized friends; some wishing to leave society and farm off-the-grid while others argue the importance to stay engaged in society and fight for change. The difficulty of industry and technology in the past and present is the control that capitalism has on weaponizing those bodies for their needs of profit. This huge burdensome cloud over the positive advancements that technology and computers have afforded many people - more particularly to those who may not have otherwise been afforded the luxury of information and world-wide reaching discourse between different communities (referring to the ways in which social media has connected people, and empowered positive change, while putting the power of free education back into the hands of the people). The essence of ‘open source’ as a countercultural concept cannot be understated.  Although the ideals prophesied in the early internet age have been diluted and over taken by the darkness of mis-information and lack of trust in the media - and even science its self - there still lives the power for many avenues to promote shared education and technological opportunities that may not have been afforded if those ideals were not present in the early computer days.
</p>
<p>Lastly my thoughts on this particular subsection:
‘Ken Colstad, a member of the project, described its aims in a 1975 issue of the People's Computer Company thus: "Such a horizontal system would allow the public to take advantage of the huge and largely untapped reservoir of skills and resources that resides with the people. . . [It would] counteract the tendencies toward fragmentation and isolation so visible in today's society.’
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while social media and the internet has connected so many people from all over the world, cultivating empathy towards many different cultures and communities, it has also hyper-injected the fragmented and isolated people with the vitriol needed to radicalize and mobilize hate.

<h4>Week 1: As We May Think</h4>

  It is always to entertaining read old writings that muse and hypothesise future technology – even more enlightening when some points made are (seemly) accidentally, but right on the money. The bulk of the paper explores the current and near future (of that time) status of data and the handling and processing of it. The way it is the heart of technology and progressing human research. Paragraph after paragraph unravelling what is, essentially at the core of information technology. It was always about the recording, storage, organization, transmission, analysis and communication of data. The heart of computer science.  There are so many instances where the author is close to embodying a technological Nostradamus -almost- with the ‘memex’ recalling a type of early iPhone prototype.

  The piece is taken from Atlantic’s 2018’s collection of iconic articles over the 160 years of the Atlantic’s publication. It is definitely an important and predictive piece of writing produced at such an iconic moment in time. After the second world war came to a close and all of the death and destruction, helped largely by the technological advancements of the time, paused for a moment. The author contemplates a peaceful wish in the first paragraph… The hope that the next generation of technological advancement is towards the betterment of the human race – and there has been aspects of that. However, much like the original purpose of many technologies at the time that were then weaponized, data sciences and computer sciences have also seen their usefulness weaponized and wielded to pit human against human. The simple bases of that technology - to organize, store and transmit data in the quickest, most effective and efficient methods possible have breed both the best and the worst in society.
